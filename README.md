# Wisclakebathy

This R-package was designed to help scientists at the Wisconsin DNR process and
analyze lake bathymetry data for Wisconsin lakes.

For examples of how to obtain lake bathymetry information and use these
functions to process and analyze lake bathymetry information, see the vignette
[WI_Lake_Bathy_Ex](https://github.com/WDNR-Water-Use/Wisclakebathy/blob/main/vignettes/WI_Lake_Bathy_Ex.Rmd).

For descriptions of the assumptions and behavior of individual functions, see
the [User
Manual](https://github.com/WDNR-Water-Use/Wisclakebathy/blob/main/Wisclakebathy_1.2.0.pdf).
